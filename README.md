# Will-I-Pass-Shell-201
A simple JS application to find if you will pass Shell's 201 or will enroll into Shesh 201 in the winter quarter.  
Motivation: If you have taken CSE 201 with Shel in UCSC, you will know that the class is notoriously tough for passing. Midterm 1 is usually easy but the fear of passing the class creeps in when you take the midterm 2. Hence me(Nayan Bhatia) and my roommate(Jayjeet Chakraborty), two extremely bored grad student decided to make this simple yet useful tool so that you can calculate the required marks in finals to pass this course.
