# Will-I-Pass-Shell-201
A simple JS application to find out if you will pass Shell's 201 or enroll in Shesh 201 in the winter quarter.  
Motivation: If you have taken CSE 201 with Shel in UCSC, you will know that the class is notoriously challenging to pass. Midterm 1 is usually straightforward, but the fear of giving the course creeps in when you take midterm 2.  Hence I (Nayan Bhatia) and my roommate(Jayjeet Chakraborty), two extremely bored grad students, decided to make this simple yet valuable tool so that you can calculate the required marks in finals to pass this course.
